about_content: |
  Hi, my name is Reed Bender and I am a full-stack engineer with over 6 years of experience specializing in machine learning and cloud engineering for biomedical research. I am currently working as a freelance engineer, building intelligent systems with generative AI to address the needs of research labs and educational platforms.

  My work is driven by the principle of super-exponential growth; I believe that innovation accelerates future innovation, and intelligent systems beget future intelligence. I collaborate closely with teams to develop these technologies, using my proficiency in various languages and frameworks to create impactful, advanced solutions. The things that I currently have the most experience working with are: <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>Docker</mark>, <mark>Nextflow</mark>, <mark>Kubernetes</mark>, <mark>git</mark>, <mark>ChatGPT</mark>, <mark>Langchain</mark>, <mark>HuggingFace</mark>, <mark>AWS</mark>, <mark>Tensorflow</mark>, <mark>Keras</mark>, and <mark>Scanpy</mark>.

        description: |
          Pria began as an idea to build a Generative AI mentor to go along with Praxis AI's digital course content. I then proceeded to build the Generative Intelligence Engine<i class="fas fa-trademark"></i>, Pria's backend <mark>Flask</mark> server. In addition to creating and maintaining this backend, I was responsible for developing <mark>Gitlab CI/CD</mark> pipelines and deploying the production application to a dynamically-scaled and load-balanced <mark>Elastic Container Service</mark>.

          While building this generative AI backend for Pria, I learned how to utilize both <mark>OpenAI</mark>'s LLMs and open-source models via <mark>HuggingFace</mark>, worked with <mark>Langchain</mark> agents and document integration chains, and created custom vector-embedding tools to expand Pria's knowledgebase.

          Pria is now being successfully used by dozens of academic institutions across the country and received two recognitions in the 2023 American Business Awards: *GOLD* for [Achievement in Online Training](https://stevieawards.com/aba/web-awards), and *BRONZE* for [Use of Artificial Intelligence in EdTech](https://stevieawards.com/aba/product-management-new-product-awards).

          In addition to building the backend for Pria, I created and led a 12-week **[Foundations of AI](https://praxis-ai.com/courses/course-ai-foundations/)** digital course, covering extensive topics from data science to generative AI integrations, which also received a *GOLD* for [K-12 Course or Learning Management Solution](https://stevieawards.com/aba/product-management-new-product-awards) at the 2023 American Business Awards. This course covers everything from introductory statistics and linear algebra to advanced deep learning architectures, culminating in students building a <mark>Transformer</mark> model from scratch.

          As the third employee to join Flagship Labs 84, I played a pivotal role in processing and analyzing our single-cell RNA-sequencing data, as well as in building our computational infrastructure from the ground up. I developed Python scripts for complex single-cell analyses while closely collaborating with wet-lab biologists to plan experiments and rapidly iterate the scope of our bioinformatics pipelines. 

          My role spanned across broad range of tasks including serving as the System Administrator for our team's expanding AWS environment, using machine learning to derive insights from <mark>Electronic Medical Records</mark>, processing single-cell gene expression data into visualizations and insghts with <mark>Scanpy</mark>, and interfacing between the computational and biological sciences while communicating effectively with both.

          I completed my Bachelor of Science in Bioengineering with a concentration in Biomaterials and a minor in Genetics, graduating from the Clemson Honors College. In my undergraduate research, I integrated patient-specific RNA-sequencing data with public consortium datasets and then implemented a novel deep-learning approach for determining patient-specific transcriptomic abserations in cancer. 
          
          This work resulted in a [co-first authorship publication](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patter.2020.100087), along with three other peer-reviewed publications and an additional conference proceeding.
