about_content: |
  Hi, my name is Reed Bender and I am a full-stack engineer with over 7 years of experience specializing in machine learning and cloud engineering for biomedical research. I am currently working as a freelance engineer, building intelligent systems with generative AI to custom suit the needs of research labs and educational platforms.

  My work is driven by the principle of super-exponential growth; I believe that innovation accelerates future innovation, and intelligent systems beget more intelligence. I collaborate closely with teams to develop these technologies, using my proficiency in various languages and frameworks to create impactful, advanced solutions. The things that I currently have the most experience working with are: <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>Docker</mark>, <mark>Nextflow</mark>, <mark>Kubernetes</mark>, <mark>Github Workflows</mark>, <mark>ChatGPT</mark>, <mark>Langchain</mark>, <mark>AWS</mark>, <mark>Tensorflow / Keras</mark>, and <mark>Scanpy</mark>.

          I started this project while consulting with [Praxis AI](https://praxis-ai.com/pria), suggesting we build a Generative AI mentor to go along with their digital course content. I then proceeded to build the **Generative Intelligence Engine**:tm:, which served as Pria's backend <mark>Flask</mark> server. I was responsible for creating and managing <mark>Gitlab CI/CD</mark> pipelines, deploying the application to a production environment in <mark>AWS</mark>, and managing billing across various API tools.

          While building this generative AI backend for Pria, I learned how to utilize both <mark>OpenAI</mark>'s LLMs and open-source models via <mark>HuggingFace</mark>, I worked with <mark>Langchain</mark> agents and document integration chains, and I built multiple Retrieval-Augmented Generation tools for integrating various data formats into Pria's core knowledgebase.
          Pria is now being successfully used by dozens of academic (institutions across the country and received two awards in the 2023 American Business Awards: *GOLD* for [Achievement in Online Training](https://stevieawards.com/aba/web-awards), and *BRONZE* for [Use of Artificial Intelligence in EdTech](https://stevieawards.com/aba/product-management-new-product-awards).
